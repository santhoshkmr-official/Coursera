while (i < 5){
    i = i – 1;
    printf(" i = %d", i);
}


If i starts off as 2 (assume int i = 2 declared at the beginning of the code) then...



[] printf will print: i = 2



[] printf will print: i = 5



[x] printf will print continuously



[] printf will print: 0

    printf(" i = %d", i);
}


If i starts off as 2 (assume int i = 2 declared at the beginning of the code) and the loop statement was i = i +1; printf will print ...



[] i = 2



[x] i = 3 i = 4 i = 5



[] will not print



[] 0
